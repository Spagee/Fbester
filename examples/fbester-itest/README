The facebook-test-java-api-itest project verifies the functionality of the API by
performing test users operations on Facebook.

In order to run the tests, a file called 'facebook-app.properties' must be created in the
src/test/resources directory. The content of the file should be

facebook.appId1=<appId>
facebook.appSecret1=<appSecret>
facebook.appId2=<appId>
facebook.appSecret2=<appSecret>

The <app ID> and <app Secret> placeholders should contain the values for your application.

Be aware that the integration test will remove all test users in the application when running!
